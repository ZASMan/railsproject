# README

Hi! This is Roxwel, and this is an app created in Rails. Not sure what else to write other than to warn other users that this is the first time I use Rails and Git/GitHub, so allow me to apologise beforehand in case something does go wrong here.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
